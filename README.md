# TicketManager

Ticket manager project by a junior web developer.

Steps to make it work on your PC:
1) Import the ticket_manager.sql file into your local database
2) Create an admin user directly from your database, in order to set its role to admin it has to have 'user_role = 1'
3) Open the directory on your browser
4) Log in as admin using the credentials you set before
5) That's it! From there you can do everything you want
